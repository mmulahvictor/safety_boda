## Description

Safety Boda is a secure website that is free to use. In Kenya, the boda boda service has been linked to an upsurge in crime. The boda boda riders commit crimes, but no one can find them since no legal information is available on them.

The goal of this project is to collect information on boda boda riders and keep it in a database. The consumer checks the number plate on the website to see if the boda boda is registered. If the rider exists, the site will verify the records and notify the consumer that the rider has been validated. Now the consumer is free to utilize the service.

If something occurs to the consumer, the law enforcement agency can access the rider's information and arrest them.

## Features

1. See check if the rider is registered.
1. There is a registration for the boda boda riders.

1. The data can be used by law enforcement if anything happens.
